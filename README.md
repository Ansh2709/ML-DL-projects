Used Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) techniques,used pipeline based on Data Ingestion->Text Preprocessing(used word tokenization,stop words removal,lower casing,tags removal,etc)->Feature Engineering(used BOW,but other WorldtoVec deep learning technique we can use here as well,tf-idf,n-grams,one-hot encoding also can be use here as well)->Data Modelling->Data Evaluation
Used different supervised learning algorihms under machine learning used for classification  i.e. random forest classifier,decision tree etc
Used my self created features,that helps to achieve better accuracy
Evaluated it using confusion matrix,accuracy,and f1-score 
One can use stemming and lemmatization under text preprocessing also can use other ML algo and can use more data for analysis for better outcomes
